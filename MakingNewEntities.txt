to make a new entity follow this basic template

at this point adding additional functions will not work because they cannot be called

feel free to add them anyway in case i can fix that glitch


class ENTITY_TYPE
{
	//constrctor

	void update();
	void update(ofVec2f mousePos, bool clicked);

	void draw();

	bool getEventDataBool();
	int getEventDataInt();

private:
	ofTexture *myTexture;

}


make sure to include all of these function or there WILL be an error

just define them to whatever and make extra variables private and stuff


textures should be declared as pointers
